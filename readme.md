#Contact module#

PyroCMS comes with a core contact module which record a contact log not accesible neither frontend nor backend.

I think is useful view that contact log, so I decided make some changes and here they are.

I took 2.2-develop module version to start.

##What's new##

* Added a new menu option under _Data_ menu.
* Added a view to list all the messages where you can view details or delete log entries.
* Added a view to see details of a message.
